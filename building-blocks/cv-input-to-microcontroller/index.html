	<h1>CV Input to Microcontroller</h1>
	<p>Many digital modules will need at least one CV input, however you have likely noticed that while Eurorack can have ±12V travelling through its patch cables, most microcontrollers will be very unhappy to receive anything outside of the range 0-3.3V.
To allow you to &lsquo;read&rsquo; the whole 12V CV range, you need to perform something called &lsquo;signal conditioning&rsquo;.
This means that you want to &lsquo;condition&rsquo; the potential range of ±12V into 0-3.3V, cutting out any parts you don&rsquo;t need to read, and scaling the parts that you do to the readable range.</p>
<p>One excellent circuit for doing just this, has been designed by Émilie Gillet of Mutable Instruments.</p>

<p>This circuit has two op-amps, which both perform very important functions.
The first op-amp (a TL07X) is set up as an inverting amplifier, so it is able to have a gain of less than 1 (Non-inverting amplifiers can only have a gain of greater than or equal to 1).</p>
<p>Its gain is -0.25, which will turn +12V into -3V, and -12V into +3V.
We still have a problem that the voltage enters negative potential, and that the voltages have been flipped.</p>
<p>Now op-amps always clip the incoming signal depending on the power supply they are given, but &lsquo;rail-to-rail&rsquo; op-amps clip very precisely, incredibly close to the power rails they are provided with.</p>
<p>Thus, by providing the second op-amp with a power supply of Ground and +3.3V, the outgoing signal has always been clipped to an absolute minimum and maximum of 0-3.3V, so cannot harm the microcontroller&rsquo;s input.</p>
<p>The op-amp used for this is an MCP600X, as it is rail-to-rail, and it is also set up in the inverting configuration, so that it will flip the voltages back to
positive = positive.</p>
<p>This circuit in its entirety will thus take a signal that potentially is anywhere in the range ±12V, and allow you to &lsquo;read&rsquo; 0-12V, and will safely clip anything below 0V to keep it at 0V. This is of course a limitation of this circuit; that it cannot &lsquo;read&rsquo; negative input CV.</p>
