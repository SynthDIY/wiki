      <description>&lt;p&gt;An optocoupler allows signal transmition between two isolated circuits with two parts: an LED that emits infrared light and a photosensitive device (LDR) which detects light from the LED.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CV Input to Microcontroller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many digital modules will need at least one CV input, however you have likely noticed that while Eurorack can have ±12V travelling through its patch cables, most microcontrollers will be very unhappy to receive anything outside of the range 0-3.3V.&#xA;To allow you to &amp;lsquo;read&amp;rsquo; the whole 12V CV range, you need to perform something called &amp;lsquo;signal conditioning&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;This means that you want to &amp;lsquo;condition&amp;rsquo; the potential range of ±12V into 0-3.3V, cutting out any parts you don&amp;rsquo;t need to read, and scaling the parts that you do to the readable range.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Digital Input to Microcontroller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most microcontrollers run on either 3.3V or 5V logic, whereas Eurorack gates and triggers are usually between 5-8V.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Thus, if you would like to &amp;lsquo;read&amp;rsquo; a digital input such as a gate or external clock source from your microcontroller, you will need some method of conditioning the incoming voltage to prevent it from damaging the chip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
