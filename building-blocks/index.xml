      <description>Many digital modules will need at least one CV input, however you have likely noticed that while Eurorack can have ±10V travelling through its patch cables, most microcontrollers will be very unhappy to receive anything outside of the range 0-3.3V. To allow you to &amp;lsquo;read&amp;rsquo; the whole 10V CV range, you need to perform something called &amp;lsquo;signal conditioning&amp;rsquo;. This means that you want to &amp;lsquo;condition&amp;rsquo; the potential range of ±10V into 0-3.</description>
