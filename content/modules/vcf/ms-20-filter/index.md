The MS-20 is a synthesizer made by Korg and it has a pretty nice sounding filter. René Schmitz has made a popular clone of it and has schematics avavailable on [his site](https://schmitzbits.de/ms20.html).
There is also a version designed by Kassutronics that adds a pot for blending between low/highpass and a drive knob to attenuate the input signal.

## Schematics
