      <description>The op-amp (operational amplifier) is a fundamental building block of analog electronics. With the addition of other simple components, they can be used to perform complex mathematical operations such as differentiation, integration, exponential conversion, etc. However, at its core, the op-amp is simply a differential amplifier with a very high gain.
The symbol for an op-amp is a triangle, with non-inverting (Vin+) and inverting (Vin-) inputs indicated by ‘+’ and ‘-‘, respectively.</description>
