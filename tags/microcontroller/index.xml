      <description>Many digital modules will need at least one CV input, however you have likely noticed that while Eurorack can have ±12V travelling through its patch cables, most microcontrollers will be very unhappy to receive anything outside of the range 0-3.3V. To allow you to &amp;lsquo;read&amp;rsquo; the whole 12V CV range, you need to perform something called &amp;lsquo;signal conditioning&amp;rsquo;. This means that you want to &amp;lsquo;condition&amp;rsquo; the potential range of ±12V into 0-3.</description>

      <title>Digital Input to Microcontroller</title>

      <description>Most microcontrollers run on either 3.3V or 5V logic, whereas Eurorack gates and triggers are usually between 5-8V.
Thus, if you would like to &amp;lsquo;read&amp;rsquo; a digital input such as a gate or external clock source from your microcontroller, you will need some method of conditioning the incoming voltage to prevent it from damaging the chip.
One very basic method could be used, which is to simply &amp;lsquo;clip&amp;rsquo; the input voltage using diodes to the input range of the microcontroller, for example using this circuit found in the Doepfer DIY page</description>
