      <description>Many digital modules will need at least one CV input, however you have likely noticed that while Eurorack can have ±12V travelling through its patch cables, most microcontrollers will be very unhappy to receive anything outside of the range 0-3.3V. To allow you to &amp;lsquo;read&amp;rsquo; the whole 12V CV range, you need to perform something called &amp;lsquo;signal conditioning&amp;rsquo;. This means that you want to &amp;lsquo;condition&amp;rsquo; the potential range of ±12V into 0-3.</description>

      <description>The op-amp (operational amplifier) is a fundamental building block of analog electronics. With the addition of other simple components, they can be used to perform complex mathematical operations such as differentiation, integration, exponential conversion, etc. However, at its core, the op-amp is simply a differential amplifier with a very high gain.
The symbol for an op-amp is a triangle, with non-inverting (Vin+) and inverting (Vin-) inputs indicated by ‘+’ and ‘-‘, respectively.</description>
