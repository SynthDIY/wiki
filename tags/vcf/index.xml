      <description>MS-20 filter The MS-20 is a synthesizer made by Korg and it has a pretty nice sounding filter. René Schmitz has made a popular clone of it and has schematics avavailable on his site. There is also a version designed by Kassutronics that has a knob for blending between low/high pass, which is nice.
