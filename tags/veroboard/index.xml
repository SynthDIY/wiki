      <title>ADSR(-ish) envelope generator</title>

      <description>This is a simple but effective envelope generator designed by Moritz Klein in his video. It approximates an ADSR by mixing together a short +12V peak and an attenuated version of the input signal and then feeding them into a capacitor through 2 diodes and potentiomters. The opposite polarity diodes in series with the pots let you control the rate the capacitor charges and discharges at independently, so you can adjust &amp;ldquo;attack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;decay + release&amp;rdquo; independently.</description>

      <description>The MS-20 is a synthesizer made by Korg and it has a pretty nice sounding filter. René Schmitz has made a popular clone of it and has schematics avavailable on his site. There is also a version designed by Kassutronics that adds a pot for blending between low/highpass and a drive knob to attenuate the input signal.
Schematics René Schmitz&amp;rsquo;s schematic (RS-20) This is a redrawn version with component names matching those on Kassutronics&amp;rsquo; KS-20 schematic.</description>
